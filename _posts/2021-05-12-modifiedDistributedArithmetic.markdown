&emsp; A algorithm based on Modified Distributed Arithmetic (MDA) to perform Multiply and Accumulate (MAC) operations.

**Reference: [An Efficient Modified Distributed Arithmetic Architecture Suitable for FIR Filter](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9419365)**

### Motivation

&emsp; MAC operation form the basis of many DSP applications.
Performing MAC operations using Distributed Arithmetic (DA) causes Look Up Tables to grow exponentially when the number of input increase and also, DA doesn't support non-scaled input.
Hence, MDA can be used to perform MAC operations when large number inputs are used and the inputs are unscaled. 

### Features

<ol>
<li>Produces Output in Fixed Number of Clock Cyles irrespective of the number of input.</li>
<li>Perform opeations on real valued numbers.</li>
<li>Can change the inputs if needed.</li>
<li>Removes Precompuation needed by DA.</li>
</ol>
